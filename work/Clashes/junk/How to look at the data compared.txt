How to read the info:

(1) I assume that the 'model' distance is the same in PROBE (P) and restraints manager (RM)
   This is not absolutely correct. I think that the 'model' can be slightly different because
   of the way PROBE samples the overlapping of spheres.
   
   Looking at (again, assuming the 'model' distance is the same) 
   Clash                           overlap RM  overlap RPROBE     diff          vdw      
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NE2 HIS A  64  NH1 ARG A  45     -0.439        -0.434        -0.005        3.100
	CE  MET A 265  CG2 THR A 262     -0.866        -0.851        -0.015        3.400 
	
	The error in the radii (diff/sqrt(2)) can be in the order of 0.01 when diff = 0.015
	and 0.004 when diff = 0.005
   
   
(2) following (1) is that 'diff', which is overlap_RM - overlap_P, is equal to vdw_P and vdw_RM.
    so 'diff' represents the different between the radii of the atoms, with +- 0.005 error
	
NOTE!!!
As of 12/5/2013 there is a known difference in the Oxygen radii PROBE and restraints manager
PROBE uses : phenix_sources\probe\atomprops.h
atom name  ,(explicit H) ecloud VDW radius, (explicit H) nuclear VDW radius, (implicit H) VDW radius
 O				1.40							1.40							1.50

restraints manager uses : phenix_sources\chem_data\mon_lib\ener_lib.cif
atomic chemical type, Van-Der-Waals radius,Van-Der-Waals radius for atom+H
 O                    1.520                1.520
 OHA                  1.520                1.680
 OHB                  1.520                1.680
