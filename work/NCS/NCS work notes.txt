min_length (int): minimum number of matching residues in a segment 
min_percent (float): min percent identity of matching residues
similarity_threshold (float): Threshold for similarity between segments
require_equal_start_match (bool): require that all matching segments start at the same relative residue number for all members of an NCS group, trimming the matching region as necessary. This is, but not otherwise
maximize_size_of_groups (bool): request that the scoring be set up to maximize the number of members in NCS groups (maximize_size_of_groups=True) or that scoring is set up to maximize the length of the matching segments in the NCS group (maximize_size_of_groups=False)
required_chains (list):
min_fraction_domain (float): domain must be this fraction of a chain
initial_rms (float): Guess of RMS among chains
match_radius (float): Keep atoms that are within match_radius of NCS-related atoms
min_contig_length (int): segments < min_contig_length rejected
smooth_length (int): two segments separated by smooth_length or less get connected
max_rmsd_domain (int): max rmsd of domains
min_fraction_represented (float): Minimum fraction of residues represented by NCS to keep. If less...skip ncs entirely
